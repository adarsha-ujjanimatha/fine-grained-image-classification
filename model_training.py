# Placeholder script for Fine-Grained Image Classification
# This would typically include data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using TensorFlow/Keras.

# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16, ResNet50

# Define the model architecture
model = VGG16(weights="imagenet", include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Placeholder for training process
print("Model architecture loaded. Training script to be added.")

# Save the model (just an example)
model.save("fine_grained_model.h5")
